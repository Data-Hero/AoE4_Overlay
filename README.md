# Streaming
To use the custom streaming overlay simply drag the `overlay.html` file to OBS or other streaming software. The file is located in `src/html` directory in the app folder. Move and rescale as necessary once some game information is shown.

If drag & drop doesn't work, add new source to your scene manually. The source type will be `Browser` and point to a local file `overlay.html`.

* Streaming overlay supports team games as well
* The streaming overlay can be fully customized with CSS and JS, see the next section.
* The override tab can be used to change the information on the overlay. This might be useful when casting from replays or changing a player's barcode to their actual name.

# Customization

1. **Overlay position and font size** can be changed in the app.

2. **Build order** font and position can be changed in the app. 
   Other attributres can be also customized in `config.json` (to find the file click `File/config & logs` in the app). You have to close the app before making changes to the config file. What can be changed:

    `"bo_bg_opacity": 0.5,` controls its background opacity (default: 0.5 = 50%; accepts values between 0 and 1)

    `"bo_showtitle": true,` sets whether build order name is visible (accepts true/false)

    `"bo_title_color": "orange",` changes the color of build order name (title), also accepts hex and rgb values as string


3. **Team colors** can be changed in the `config.json`. Colors are stored as a list of RGBA colors for team 1, 2, and so on.

    ```json
    "team_colors": [
        [74, 255, 2, 0.35],
        [3, 179, 255, 0.35],
        [255, 0, 0, 0.35]
      ]
    ```
    
4. **Civilization stats color** can be changed in `config.json`.
    ```json
    "civ_stats_color": "#BC8AEA",
    ```

5. **Streaming overlay** customization can be done via `custom.css` and `custom.js` in the `html` folder in app directory. These files will not be overridden with an app update. Look at `main.css` to see what you can change. In `custom.js` you can define this function that runs after each update.

    ```javascript
    function custom_func(data) {
        console.log("These are all the player data:", data);
    }
    ```
